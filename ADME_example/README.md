## Model building guide

The model_building directory contains the following

1. `process_data.ipynb` pulls data from Polaris and processes the data for model building
2. `run_benchmark.py` runs 5x5 repeated cross validation and saves results for downstream analysis

`ML_Regression_Comparison.ipynb` demonstrates the recommended statistical testing workflow.

`supplementary_workflows` contains the following notebooks:

1. Statistical testing for classification models (`ML_Classification_Comparison.ipynb`)
2. Statistical testing for exceptional cases (`ML_Regression_Comparison_nonparametric.ipynb`)
3. Additional visualization ideas (`alternate_visualizations.ipynb`)
